# About
This is a software renderer written in C, made with SDL2. 
It supports Z-buffering, backface culling, and frustum culling.
I will note the Z-buffering at this point in time is a tad wonky. Also there is no texture support yet. 

There are some pseudo-lighting effects that I thought were pretty cool though! :D All I did though was just
make farther objects and objects which have normals that are rotated away from the camera appear darker. 
Nothing fancy. 

# Building
## Mac OS and Linux
Only dependency other than standard libraries is SDL2. Once you have that installed, just run the build script in the source directory. 

## Windows
To quote the great [jdh](https://github.com/jdah/minecraft-weekend?tab=readme-ov-file#windows):
*good luck ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è probably try building under WSL and using an X environment to pass graphics through.*
